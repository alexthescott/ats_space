            <p>
                Around 2018, I stumbled across and was immediately enamored by <a href="https://ashcroft.dev/" class="hyperlink">Jon Ashcroft</a>'s
                <a href="https://ashcroft.dev/blog/now-playing-screen-spotify-raspberry-pi-es6/" class="hyperlink"> 'Now Playing' Spotify Frame project</a>
                which displays the album art and track information on a small LCD display connected to a Raspberry Pi. As a music and computer nerd, I knew 
                I wanted to build something similar to permanently sit on my desk. I think Jon's project is great, and there are benefits to using LCD screens 
                for brightness, color, and refresh rate all of which are great fits for his 'web first' approach of building and launching a website in kiosk mode. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Around the same time, I began to take an interest in ePaper displays, which are far more power efficient at the cost of low refresh rates, poor color 
                replication, high latency, and greater material cost. In researching similar projects, I found <a href="https://brettcvz.com/" class="hyperlink">Brett van Zuiden</a>'s 
                <a href="https://brettcvz.com/projects/6-upnext" class="hyperlink"">UpNext project</a> from March of 2020, utilizing a WaveShare 4.2inch ePaper display, 
                Raspberry Pi and Google Calendar API to create a "subtle, unobtrusive digital desktop calendar" which "does one thing and does it well."
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h2 class="text-">Rules:</h2>
            <p>Broadly, I wanted the functionality of Jon Ashcroft's 'Now Playing' in the fit and form of Brett Van Zuiden's 'UpNext project' using the same 4.2inch ePaper Display.
